- Methods reproducibility: from data to figure understanding the steps (the only change is the analyst is different) -- Minimal standard and we expect it in the lab. 
- Results reproducibility: everything is the same but the analysis - we use it in new data (as DiMSum pipeline)
- Inferential reproducibility

* Reproducibility Project: Cancer Study - only 18/50 could be replicated. 
* Only 36% psychology studies can be replicated
* John Ioannidis paper: Why Most Published Research Findings Are False https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124 

We would like to achieve *linked and executable code and data* - maybe this is something that we could implement for TDP43 paper as well... (Andr√© was interested). 
EU funding asks for data management plan http://www.dcc.ac.uk

Data management plan: 
* Administrative data
* Data collection 
* Documentation and metadata: 
**Metadata is quite miscellaneous - within lab we don't standarize it. Do we understand the folder structure of our labmates? (FOLDER STRUCTURE)
* Ethics and Legal compliance: 
** Analysis-to-data pipeline: allows you to know how your data looks like but without having your data (cool when your data is private and delicate)
* Storage and backup 
* Selection and preservation: 
** How long we should store our data? FOREVER if possible. At least 10 years for shitty data. 
* Data Sharing
** Where?
* Responsibilities and resources

In exploratory analysis we can also include our uncertainity. For the data management plan, we will always know the data for our confirmatory part. After that, we can complement w/ our additional data. We can state that we are gonna update our data management plan. 

* Re3data: https://www.re3data.org/: searcher for databases and repositories: good to check permissions of lots of repositories and to find new repositiories that might be for us.
* Zenodo: stores your GitHub repository as it is, you can make changes on your repositories but in Zenodo it will stay the same (it gives you a DOI to your GitHub account in that moment). 
* GitHub and GitLab: controlled by git (version control)

* Pre-process the data to share it (this makes data available and memmory affordable to other users with a non-excessive bioinformatician profile). To what extent? Let's make it easy for other people and carry out the difficult analysis. Identify the worst part and make it for the users. 
* Notebooks: take people through the results of our paper, not to ru big processes on them. 

*How can we ensure that we can run our codes in 10 years?*
With version control tools (GitHub). It helps to keep track of your code. To make changes it's good (mandatory in case of working in groups) to work using branches.
